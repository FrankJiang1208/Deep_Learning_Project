What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 

Here is my target for my model:  
IS_SUCCESSFUL    



What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 

Here are the features of my model: 
APPLICATION_TYPE          
AFFILIATION               
CLASSIFICATION            
USE_CASE                  
ORGANIZATION              
STATUS                     
INCOME_AMT                
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS    
ASK_AMT   

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 

I removed the EIN and NAME columns

Were you able to achieve the target model performance? 

I was not able to achieve the targeted performance

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

I added epochs and layers to the deep learning model

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

My model only obtained an accuracy of 70 percent and I could improve it by removing more of the unnecessary features. Another way to solve this is using a random forest classifier or logistic classifier since we will have more control and understanding over those models instead of the deep learning model
